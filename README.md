Angular vs Backbone: Go Mobile!
Angular or Backbone, which one you will use in your mobile app?  How could you develop a mobile app across iOS, Android or windows devices?  This project will take an intimate look at two of today’s most popular frameworks, Angular and Backbone and explore their differences.  We’ll show how Apache Cordova opens the world of mobile app development to web developers. In the project, we will develop a “To Do” app using Angular and Backbone, with access to native device capabilities.
