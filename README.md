Angular vs Backbone: Go Mobile!
Angular or Backbone, which one you will use in your mobile app?  How could you develop a mobile app across iOS, Android or windows devices?  This talk will take an intimate look at two of today’s most popular frameworks, Angular and Backbone and explore their differences.  We’ll show how Apache Cordova opens the world of mobile app development to web developers. In the session, we will demonstrate a “To Do” app using Angular and Backbone, with access to native device capabilities. We’ll compare the frameworks when transported to the world of mobile app development. Along the way, you'll also learn what kind of apps are best-suited for the hybrid architecture and when to make the switch from web app to mobile app.
